<p>Where else can you get top-notch education and perfect beach weather? At UCSD, you can finish your quantum physics homework while watching a sunset at La Jolla Shores. Plus, we’ve got Triton tacos that will change your life. You’ll find world-class research and a squirrel population that’s suspiciously friendly. So, whether you’re here for the academics, the beach, or just to figure out why we have a giant talking bear on campus (seriously, it's a thing), welcome to UCSD - where nerds go to thrive and tan.</p>
